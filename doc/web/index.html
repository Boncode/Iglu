        Iglu R.0.9.83 turned out to be a nice, stable platform.<br>
        It can be found <a href="http://iglu.ijsberg.org/iglu.0.9.83.html">here</a>.
        Iglu v.1.0 is rebuilt from scratch.<br>
        It's more pure, less intrusive and better tested.
        Iglu v.0.99 can be found <a href="https://github.com/jmeetsma/Iglu">here</a>.
